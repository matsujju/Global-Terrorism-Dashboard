# Global Terrorism Dashboard Project

This repository contains files for this Dashboard.
This app is made with [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) interactive python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plotly.com/).
Dash is a simple and effective to bind user interface around python code.
## Overview -
  * The Project is a Dashboard built for getting proper data insight through interactive visualization.
  * This is built around the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd) (GTD) and more about the [data](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/), it's collection methodology, definitions, and coding schema can be found [here](https://start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf).
  * The Project includes Terrorism activities around the world reported between [1970-2017] with more than 180,000 incidents.

- Important highlights :
  * Geography: Worldwide
  * Time period: 1970-2017, except 1993
  * Unit of analysis: Attacks and Casualities
  * Variables: >100 variables on location, tactics, perpetrators, targets, and outcomes but used around <ins>30 parameters as most of them has more than *80% missing values*</ins>.
  * Sources: Unclassified media articles (<ins>Note: Please interpret changes over time with caution. Global patterns are driven by diverse trends in particular regions, and data collection is influenced by fluctuations in access to media coverage over both time and place.</ins>)
  * Definition of terrorism:
      "The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."
